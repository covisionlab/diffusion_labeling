# Bounding Box-Guided Diffusion for Industrial Image Synthesis

This repository contains the official implementation of the paper:
["Bounding Box-Guided Diffusion for Synthesizing Industrial Images and Segmentation Map"](https://arxiv.org/abs/2505.03623) accepted at Synthetic Data for Computer Vision Workshop - CVPR 2025

## 📌 Overview

This project introduces a diffusion-based generative framework guided by bounding boxes to synthesize high-quality industrial images along with corresponding segmentation maps. The method is designed to support precise localization, multi-part control, and mask generation, facilitating dataset creation for downstream tasks like defect detection and segmentation.

## 🧩 Features

- Conditional image synthesis based on bounding boxes
- Joint generation of segmentation maps
- Supports multiple object types and classes
